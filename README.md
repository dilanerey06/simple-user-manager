# User manager (Study Project)

## Description

Frontend application made using: JavaScript, ReactJS, Bootstrap 5.0, Hooks, Custom hooks.

It is just a study project, doesn't connect with any API or Backend technologie, it was made in my learning process of React hooks. It's a user manager that uses a form with controlled components and
then prints the data in a user list component. It will be on github pages soon but if you want to run this project in local take a look in the section below :).
